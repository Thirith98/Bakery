SYNTAX: ./main.o X [Y] [Z]

    // X = 1 // Making Bread

    // Y = 0 // Fairlearners
    // Y = 1 // Fastlearners
    // Y = 2 // Arrivalorder
    // Y = 3 // default, Prelearners (called fast learners in the project description)
    // Y = 4 // Scenario 2

    // Z = 0 // Slow test, the apprentices take some time to make bread, so the prints are printed slowly
    // Z = 1 // Fast test, so the apprentices bake bread as fast as they can, so the end statistics can be seen without waiting forever
